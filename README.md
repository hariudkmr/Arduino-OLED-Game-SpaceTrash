Introduction

Dear friends,

Welcome to Pi BOTS MakerHub. Today we are going to make a Game using Arduino and OLED Display.

I recommend using the 128x64 pixels OLED display with I2C or SPI Communication, and a smaller Arduino like PRO Mini. But I use Arduino UNO since Components are not available for purchase due to COVID19. We could make this game console using ATtiny85 also.
